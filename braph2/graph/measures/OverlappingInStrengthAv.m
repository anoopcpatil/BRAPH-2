    % OverlappingInStrengthAv Average overlapping in-strength measure
    % OverlappingInStrengthAv provides the average overlapping in-strength of a graph
    % for weighted directed (WD) multiplexes. 
    %
    % It is calculated as the average of the sum of the in-strength of a node in all layers.
