MultiplexBUDEnsemble < MultiplexBUD (g, ensemble of binary undirected multiplexes with fixed densities) is an ensemble of binary undirected multiplexes with fixed densities.

%%% ¡description!
In an ensemble of binary undirected multiplexes with fixed densities (BUD), 
all the layers consist of binary undirected (BU) multiplexes derived from 
the same weighted supra-connectivity matrices binarized at different densities.
There are no connections between layers.
