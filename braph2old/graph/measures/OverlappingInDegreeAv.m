    % OverlappingInDegreeAv Average overlapping in-degree measure
    % OverlappingInDegreeAv provides the average overlapping in-degree of a graph
    % for binary directed (BD) and weighted directed (WD) multiplexes. 
    %
    % It is calculated as the average of the sum of the number of inward edges 
    % connected to the node in all layers, i.e., it is the average of the sum of the 
    % in-degree of a node in all layers.
