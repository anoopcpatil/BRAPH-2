BRAPH 2.0 is an open-source MATLAB-based software that provides advanced capabilities for brain connectivity analysis. It offers a comprehensive range of features, including conventional graph theory, multilayer graphs, and deep learning techniques. With its user-friendly interface and extensive analysis pipelines, researchers can explore the complex organization of the human brain using multimodal neuroimaging data, going beyond the limitations of traditional approaches.

## Welcome to BRAPH 2.0

BRAPH 2.0 is designed to facilitate the analysis of brain connectivity using various neuroimaging modalities and cutting-edge techniques. It enables researchers to assess the intricate nature of brain organization by leveraging multimodal data and incorporating advanced tools such as deep learning. The software provides an extensive set of analysis pipelines accessible through a graphical user interface (GUI) and sample scripts, allowing users to perform ready-to-use analyses or develop customized pipelines for their specific research needs.

### Installation

To install BRAPH 2.0, follow these steps:
<ol>
    <li>Ensure that you have MATLAB R2021a or a later version installed on your system. BRAPH 2.0 is compatible with the versions of MATLAB for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have the following toolboxes installed in MATLAB:
    <ul>
        <li>Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (required)</li>
        <li>Parallel Computing Toolbox (optional)</li>
        <li>Deep Learning Toolbox (optional, for deep learning analysis)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Download the latest stable version of BRAPH 2.0 from our <a href="https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab/releases">GitHub repository</a> or from our <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/">website</a>.</li>
    <li>Unzip the downloaded file into the desired directory on your system.</li>
    <li>Launch MATLAB and change the current folder to the "braph2genesis" folder located in the directory where you unzipped BRAPH 2.0. You may need to add the folder to the MATLAB path.</li>
    <li>Run the script <code>braph2genesis</code> in MATLAB. This installation process may take up to one hour to complete. You only need to run this script once or whenever there is an update to BRAPH 2.0.</li>
    <li>After the installation is complete, you can run BRAPH 2.0 by navigating to the "braph2" folder in MATLAB and running the script <code>braph2</code>. This will launch the graphical user interface (GUI) from which you can choose an analysis pipeline to start your analysis.</li>
</ol>  

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips, you can refer to the <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/#installation">Installation</a> section on the BRAPH 2.0 website.

### Use cases

### For developers

BRAPH 2.0 is designed to be an open community-driven project, and the code is freely available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab">https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab</a>. Developers can contribute to BRAPH 2.0 at various levels of complexity, ranging from editing existing pipelines and adapting example scripts to implementing entirely new features.

The software architecture of BRAPH 2.0 provides a clear structure for developers to understand and extend the functionality of the software. All objects in BRAPH 2.0 are derived from a base object called <code>Element</code>. The core code includes the compiler (<code>genesis</code>), the essential source code (<code>src</code>), and the GUI functionalities (<code>gui</code>). Developers can easily add new elements such as brain surfaces, atlases, example scripts, GUI pipelines, graphs, measures, data types, data importers, data exporters, and analyses. By writing new elements and recompiling the code, the new elements and their functionalities are immediately integrated into the GUI.

Developers can take advantage of the flexibility of BRAPH 2.0 in several ways:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Adapting a Pipeline Script</strong>: The simplest way to customize BRAPH 2.0 is by modifying a <code>.braph2</code> pipeline script. This allows users to define parameters and adjust the analysis steps according to their specific requirements. The developer tutorial <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/for-developers/new-pipeline">Adapting a Pipeline Script</a> provides guidance on adapting pipeline scripts.</li>
    <li><strong>Editing Example Scripts</strong>: Developers can also edit the example scripts provided with the software to have more control over the analysis workflow and leverage parallel computing for faster calculations. For example, these scripts can be used to run calculations on a cluster. The developer tutorial <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/for-developers/adapt-a-script-for-graph-measure-calculation">Calculating Different Measures</a> demonstrates how to modify example scripts.</li>
    <li><strong>Expanding BRAPH 2.0 with New Functionalities</strong>: BRAPH 2.0's object-oriented programming makes it easy to update, debug, and maintain the code. Developers can extend existing elements or create new ones to introduce additional features. The tutorials <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/for-developers/new-graph">Implement a new Graph</a>, <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/for-developers/new-measure">Implement a new Measure</a>, and <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/for-developers/new-subject">Implement a new Subject</a> demonstrate how to create new graphs, measures, and data types, respectively. Developers can also add new analyses by extending the elements <code>AnalysisGroup</code> or <code>AnalysisEnsemble</code>, as shown in the tutorials <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/for-developers/new-analysis-group">Implement a new Group Analysis</a> and <a href="http://braph.org/tutorials/for-developers/new-analysis-ensemble">Implement a new Ensemble Analysis</a>.</li>
</ol>
