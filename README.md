BRAPH 2.0 is an open-source MATLAB-based software that provides advanced capabilities for brain connectivity analysis. It offers a comprehensive range of features, including conventional graph theory, multilayer graphs, and deep learning techniques. With its user-friendly interface and extensive analysis pipelines, researchers can explore the complex organization of the human brain using multimodal neuroimaging data, going beyond the limitations of traditional approaches.

## Welcome to BRAPH 2.0

BRAPH 2.0 is designed to facilitate the analysis of brain connectivity using various neuroimaging modalities and cutting-edge techniques. It enables researchers to assess the intricate nature of brain organization by leveraging multimodal data and incorporating advanced tools such as deep learning. The software provides an extensive set of analysis pipelines accessible through a graphical user interface (GUI) and sample scripts, allowing users to perform ready-to-use analyses or develop customized pipelines for their specific research needs.

### Installation

To install BRAPH 2.0, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have MATLAB R2021a or a later version installed on your system. BRAPH 2.0 is compatible with the versions of MATLAB for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

2. Make sure you have the following toolboxes installed in MATLAB:
    * Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (required
    * Parallel Computing Toolbox (optional)
    * Deep Learning Toolbox (optional, for deep learning analysis)

3. Download the latest stable version of BRAPH 2.0 from our <a href="https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab/releases">GitHub repository</a> or from our <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/">website</a>.

4. Unzip the downloaded file into the desired directory on your system.

5. Launch MATLAB and change the current folder to the "braph2genesis" folder located in the directory where you unzipped BRAPH 2.0. You may need to add the folder to the MATLAB path.

6. Run the script <code>braph2genesis</code> in MATLAB. This installation process may take up to one hour to complete. You only need to run this script once or whenever there is an update to BRAPH 2.0.

7. After the installation is complete, you can run BRAPH 2.0 by navigating to the "braph2" folder in MATLAB and running the script <code>braph2</code>. This will launch the graphical user interface (GUI) from which you can choose an analysis pipeline to start your analysis.

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips, you can refer to the <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/#installation">Installation</a> section on the BRAPH 2.0 website.

### Use Cases & Analysis Pipelines

BRAPH 2.0 provides a range of analysis pipelines that can be used for various use cases in brain connectivity analysis. Here are some possible use cases of BRAPH 2.0:

1. **Conventional Single-Layer Analyses**: BRAPH 2.0 offers pipelines for analyzing single-layer graphs derived from different kinds of neuroimaging data. These pipelines involve loading the brain atlas, loading the subject data, constructing the graph, calculating graph measures of interest, and comparing groups. Single-layer analyses can be performed on connectivity data, functional data, and structural data.

2. **Multilayer Analyses**: BRAPH 2.0 supports the analysis of multilayer graphs, which capture the connectivity patterns across multiple layers or modalities. The multilayer analysis pipelines involve similar steps as single-layer analyses but operate on multilayer graphs. This allows researchers to explore the relationships between different layers or modalities of brain connectivity.

3. **Deep Learning Analyses**: BRAPH 2.0 enables the analysis of brain connectivity data using deep learning techniques. The deep learning pipelines involve loading the brain atlas, loading the subject data, constructing the input for deep learning models, splitting the dataset, training the models, and evaluating the model performance. Deep learning analyses can be applied to connectivity data, functional data, and structural data.

These are just a few examples of the use cases supported by BRAPH 2.0. The software offers a wide range of analysis pipelines and measures, allowing researchers to investigate various aspects of brain connectivity in different research domains.

For detailed information about each analysis pipeline, including their functionalities and step-by-step instructions, refer to the BRAPH 2.0 [pipeline tutorials](https://github.com/giovannivolpe/BRAPH-2-Matlab-beta/tree/develop/tutorials/pipelines).

### For developers

BRAPH 2.0 is designed to be an open community-driven project, and the code is freely available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab">https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab</a>. Developers can contribute to BRAPH 2.0 at various levels of complexity, ranging from editing existing pipelines and adapting example scripts to implementing entirely new features.

The software architecture of BRAPH 2.0 provides a clear structure for developers to understand and extend the functionality of the software. All objects in BRAPH 2.0 are derived from a base object called <code>Element</code>. The core code includes the compiler (<code>genesis</code>), the essential source code (<code>src</code>), and the GUI functionalities (<code>gui</code>). Developers can easily add new elements such as brain surfaces, atlases, example scripts, GUI pipelines, graphs, measures, data types, data importers, data exporters, and analyses. By writing new elements and recompiling the code, the new elements and their functionalities are immediately integrated into the GUI.

For all details on how to do this, refer to the BRAPH 2.0 [developer tutorials](https://github.com/giovannivolpe/BRAPH-2-Matlab-beta/tree/develop/tutorials/developers).
