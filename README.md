BRAPH 2.0 is an open-source MATLAB-based software that provides advanced capabilities for brain connectivity analysis. It offers a comprehensive range of features, including conventional graph theory, multilayer graphs, and deep learning techniques. With its user-friendly interface and extensive analysis pipelines, researchers can explore the complex organization of the human brain using multimodal neuroimaging data, going beyond the limitations of traditional approaches.

## Welcome to BRAPH 2.0

BRAPH 2.0 is designed to facilitate the analysis of brain connectivity using various neuroimaging modalities and cutting-edge techniques. It enables researchers to assess the intricate nature of brain organization by leveraging multimodal data and incorporating advanced tools such as deep learning. The software provides an extensive set of analysis pipelines accessible through a graphical user interface (GUI) and sample scripts, allowing users to perform ready-to-use analyses or develop customized pipelines for their specific research needs.

### Installation

To install BRAPH 2.0, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you have MATLAB R2021a or a later version installed on your system. BRAPH 2.0 is compatible with the versions of MATLAB for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.</li>
  
  <li>Make sure you have the following toolboxes installed in MATLAB:
    <ul>
      <li>Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (required)</li>
      <li>Parallel Computing Toolbox (optional)</li>
      <li>Deep Learning Toolbox (optional, for deep learning analysis)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Download the latest stable version of BRAPH 2.0 from our <a href="https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab/releases">GitHub repository</a> or from our <a href="http://braph.org/software/braph-2/">website</a>.</li>
  
  <li>Unzip the downloaded file into the desired directory on your system.</li>
  
  <li>Launch MATLAB and change the current folder to the "braph2genesis" folder located in the directory where you unzipped BRAPH 2.0. You may need to add the folder to the MATLAB path.</li>
  
  <li>Run the script <code>braph2genesis</code> in MATLAB. This installation process may take up to one hour to complete. You only need to run this script once or whenever there is an update to BRAPH 2.0.</li>
  
  <li>After the installation is complete, you can run BRAPH 2.0 by navigating to the "braph2" folder in MATLAB and running the script <code>braph2</code>. This will launch the graphical user interface (GUI) from which you can choose an analysis pipeline to start your analysis.</li>
</ol>
