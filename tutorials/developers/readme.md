# BRAPH 2.0 - For Developers

Welcome to the BRAPH 2.0 development guide! This section provides instructions and examples for developers who want to extend and enhance BRAPH 2.0 with new functionalities. Whether you want to adapt existing pipelines, modify example scripts, or implement completely new features, this guide will walk you through the different levels of complexity in BRAPH 2.0 development.

## Adapting a Pipeline Script

If you need to increase the number of groups in a pipeline script, you can follow the steps outlined in the tutorial [Adapting a Pipeline Script to Increase the Number of Groups](link-to-tutorial). This tutorial will guide you through the process of modifying the pipeline script to accommodate your specific requirements.

## Editing an Example Script

To calculate different measures using an example script, you can refer to the tutorial [Editing an Example Script to Calculate Different Measures](link-to-tutorial). This tutorial provides detailed instructions on how to modify the example script to compute the measures of interest.

## Expanding BRAPH 2.0 with New Functionalities

BRAPH 2.0's object-oriented programming architecture makes it easy to expand its capabilities by introducing new elements and features. Here are some of the ways you can extend BRAPH 2.0:

- **Graphs**: Developers can implement new graph types by extending the `Graph` element. The tutorial [Implement a new Graph](link-to-tutorial) provides a step-by-step guide on how to create new graph types.

- **Measures**: New measures can be added to BRAPH 2.0 by extending the `Measure` element. The tutorial [Implement a new Measure](link-to-tutorial) explains the process of implementing custom measures.

- **Subjects**: Developers can introduce new data types by extending the `Subject` element. The tutorial [Implement a new Subject](link-to-tutorial) provides guidance on creating new data types for subjects.

- **Group-based and Ensemble-based Analyses**: New analysis pipelines can be added to BRAPH 2.0 by extending the `AnalysisGroup` or `AnalysisEnsemble` elements. The tutorials in this category demonstrate the process of implementing new analysis pipelines:
  - [Implement a new Group Analysis](link-to-tutorial)
  - [Implement a new Ensemble Analysis](link-to-tutorial)

- **Deep-learning Functionalities**: New functionalities for deep-learning analyses can be swiftly integrated into BRAPH 2.0 as well. Here are the tutorials for expanding BRAPH 2.0 with deep-learning features:
  - [Implement a new Neural Network Classifier](link-to-tutorial)
  - [Implement a new Neural Network Regressor](link-to-tutorial)
  - [Implement a new Neural Network Evaluator for Classification](link-to-tutorial)
  - [Implement a new Neural Network Evaluator for Regression](link-to-tutorial)

These tutorials provide step-by-step instructions and examples to guide developers in expanding BRAPH 2.0 with new functionalities. We encourage developers to contribute to the growth and improvement of BRAPH 2.0 by introducing new elements, measures, and analyses. Feel free to share your implementations, ask questions, and engage with the BRAPH community through the [BRAPH forum](http://braph.org/forums) and [GitHub page](https://github.com/softmatterlab/BRAPH-2-Matlab).

Happy developing!
